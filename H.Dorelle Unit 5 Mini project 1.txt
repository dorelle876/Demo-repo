Unit 5 Mini Project: Creating and inserting data


Please copy your SQL below for each of the three tasks.


* Create and populate a videos table. 
   * This table should include a unique ID, the title of the video, the length in minutes, and the URL. 
   * Populate the table with at least three related videos from YouTube or other publicly available resources.
              
 CREATE TABLE videos(
    id serial PRIMARY KEY, 
    minutes INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(255));


INSERT INTO Videos ( Id, Title, minutes, Url ) 
VALUES ( 1, 'Les miserables', 98, 'https://www.youtube.com'),
       ( 2, 'Black Panther', 120, 'https://www.netflix.com'),
       ( 3, 'Squid Game', 160, 'https://www.guru.com'),
       ( 4, 'King of Boys', 75, 'https://www.holulu.com'),
       ( 5, 'Anaconda', 126, 'https://www.tiktok.com');
  
  


* Create and populate reviewers table.
   * Create a second table that provides at least two user reviews for each of at least two of the videos. 
   * These should be imaginary reviews that include columns for the user’s name (“Asher”, “John”, etc.), the rating (which could be NULL, or a number between 0 and 5), and a short text review (“Loved it!”).  There should be a column that links back to the ID column in the table of videos.


                                           CREATE TABLE Reviewers (
                                       id serial primary key,
                                          Rating INT NULL,
                                     Users VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                                        Review VARCHAR(10),
                                         video_Id INT REFERENCES Reviewers);




                                                 INSERT INTO reviewers (users,rating,review) 
                                                 VALUES ('Asher',5, 'loved it')
                                                              ('John', 5, 'loved it');
          


          Report on Video Reviews.  
   * Write a JOIN statement that shows information from both tables.
   * Write at least one query showing analysis of the joined table.


SELECT
FROM videos v INNER JOIN Reviewers r
ON v.Id = r. video_Id;
